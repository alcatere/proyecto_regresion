## First regression project

I did this project with the purpose of strengthening my knowledge in regression and to consolidating what I have learned
in previous courses, also how to use the scikit-learn libraries for regression topics, as well as various
analysis performed on the database.

## Preview

In this project i did an analysis of a company that wants to know the about factors of the satisfaction level that its
employees have in the company.

After discovering the most important factors in how satisfied employees are, i did several Machine learning
models to see who will bring better results.

I put all my thoughts and insights that i discover and the results that i achieved in this project.
